Hi there, thanks for visiting my website ðŸ˜‹!

I am a rising 4th year PhD Candidate in Quant Marketing at [Emory University - Goizueta Business School](https://goizueta.emory.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of High Dimensional Data, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference, with applications in Marketing. My current research topics include: **Multimodal Machine Learning, Generative Models, Applied Causal Inference**, and **Public Policy and Marketing**. My advisor is [Prof. David Schweidel](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/david-schweidel).

I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at the [Foreign Trade University](https://english.ftu.edu.vn) in sunny Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, before moving to Madison, Wisconsin for an MBA/MSc in Marketing Analytics at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Inbetween the two degrees, I spent two years working in fintech in Vietnam, during which I led the development of one of the earliest financial management chatbot. 

This website is still mostly under construction, and it will be updated with more info about my research soon!
