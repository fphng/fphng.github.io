Hi there, thanks for visiting my website ðŸ˜‹!

I am a rising 4th year PhD Candidate in Quant Marketing at [Emory University - Goizueta Business School](https://goizueta.emory.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of Multimodal Data, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference, with a focus on applications in Marketing. My current research projects involve the follow themes: **Multimodal Machine Learning, Generative Models, Applied Causal Inference**, and **Public Policy and Marketing**. My advisor at Emory is [Prof. David Schweidel](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/david-schweidel).

I finished my undergraduate degree in Economics at the [Foreign Trade University](https://english.ftu.edu.vn) in sunny Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, before moving to Madison, Wisconsin for an MBA/MSc in Marketing Analytics at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Inbetween the two degrees, I spent two years working in the fintech industry, during which I led the development of one of the earliest financial management chatbot. 

This website is still mostly under construction, and it will be updated with more info about my research soon! In the mean time, feel free to shoot me [an email](mailto:phuc.hung.nguyen@emory.edu) if you want to chat or collaborate!
