Hi there, thanks for visiting my website ðŸ˜‹!

I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in Quant Marketing at [Emory University - Goizueta Business School](https://goizueta.emory.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of High Dimensional Data, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference, with applications in Marketing. My current research topics include: **Multimodal Machine Learning and Causal Inference, Applied Causal Inference with High Dimensional Data**, and **Public Policy and Marketing**. My advisor is [Prof. David Schweidel](https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/profiles/david-schweidel).


This website is still mostly under construction, and it will be updated with more info about my research soon!
